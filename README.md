Submission for Hackpad.

This is a macropad built for playing games. It has an OLED screen, allowing smaller games to be shown. There are 6 buttons, which can be used as the 4 directions and then 2 more for other actions.

## PCB

The dimensions of the PCB are 65 mm by 92.5 mm.

## Cases

Not Done

## Assembly

Assembling will not take very long. Once the PCB is completed (the OLED screen, XIAO, and buttons are all connected), it should be able to be put into the case. Then you can put the top of the case on, and it's done.
